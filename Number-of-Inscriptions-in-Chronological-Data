I just did an open search into the Epigraphic Database Heidelburg.

The following URL is attached.
https://via.hypothes.is/http://edh-www.adw.uni-heidelberg.de/inschrift/statistik?hd_nr=&land=%3F&fo_antik=&fo_modern_fundstelle=&literatur=&dat_jahr_a=&dat_jahr_e=&hist_periode=&atext1=&bool=AND&atext2=&sort=hd_nr&anzahl=20

The results that came up were generally data noting when and where the site had data collected.
I looked into the number of inscriptions distributed by chronological dates starting in 70 BC Ã¢ÂÂ 450 AD.
The chart shows that in 160AD that is the period in which they have the most artifacts collected. 



practive round 2..
